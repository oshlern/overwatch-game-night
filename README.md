# overwatch-game-night


Plan:

- Gitignored private file with data on players, ranks, role preferences (gotten from google sheet csv)
- Data file of custom games
- Home page, team balancing page, arcade game picker page
- Persistent memory of tokens for each person.
- Award voting page:
    - Ability for users to connect and nominate a player
    - A round of voting on the nominees (for each category)
    - Category for "most improved on new hero", "biggest clutch", "most stylish play/skin",
    - Winning award triggers animation and rewards that person a permanent token

I want to host this locally and let people connect who I share the ip with. The persistent data should be saved locally (including the logs of arcade games, and 6v6 matches with date and who was playing, and the tokens for each player)
